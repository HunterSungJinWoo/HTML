        Pastel de Nata Recipe (Portuguese Custard Tarts)
    </p>
    <p>
        These Portuguese custard tarts are dangerously delicious. You might think that one would be enough, but only if 
        you’ve never tried one. Because there’s something addictive about the 
        combo of blistered, caramelized custard and flaky golden brown puff pastry.    
    </p>
    <p>
        Try one, and you’re hooked for life!

        The most famous custard tarts come from the town of Belém, just outside of Lisbon. Here, in the Jerónimos Monastery, the famous recipe was born!
